You are likely embarking upon something new, exciting, and invigorating with great enthusiasm and optimism. Revel in this mood, enjoy this phase of the journey, march to your own beat. Even if others disapprove, ignore them and do what suits you. Do what you feel you need to do. Turn the page, write a new chapter, begin a different pathway and story for yourself. Only you can live your life, the opinion of others is none of your concern. This new beginning is entirely your own design and ambition.</p>"

There is no rush. You can’t force the learning curve, it will unfold at its own pace. Know that you’re going to learn what you need to know as you walk along. Just be clear-eyed and open-minded so you can see your own shortcomings or lack of knowledge and be pro active about addressing that as it emerges. See this as a journey of discovery and growth. See this as a rebirth.</p>"

Perhaps you’ve become trapped in an overthinking spiral where every option now looks loaded with jeopardy and risk.

This is a time to think out of the box. It’s unlikely that just carrying on along the same path will yield the results you deserve or desire. It’s likely that you need to change course and take the uncharted route. Don’t be scared. Don’t hang back and stick to the Devil you know.</p>"

You have perhaps been preparing for this for a long time, in your sub conscious, without realising it. Life is all preparation for what lies ahead. We are the sum of our experience.</p>"

He is making a blessing sign with his right hand with two fingers pointing to heaven and two pointing to hell, as he is the one that bridges that gap.

In numerology six is the number of Venus and represents a sacred union which is fitting for this card. The Lovers also represents the sign of Gemini, known as the twins. It’s a meeting of the minds where you have found your second half. The traditional imagery on the Rider Waite deck is that of a picture of Adam and Eve with a guardian angel behind them, blessing their union. Behind Adam is the tree of life bearing 12 fruits, and behind Eve is the tree of knowledge including the snake begging her to eat the fruit. This card represents the innocence and youthfulness of love, and its beginning stages before all of the drama occurs. The Devil, (card number 15) mirrors this card and represents the Lovers after they have mated, when trouble has set in. The couple on the card are naked representing the offering up of themselves as a whole. In the Garden of Eden, they don’t even know that they are naked until she eats the apple that the snake offers her. Once they realize that they are exposed they wear clothes.</p>"

He wants the experience, and may not want to be tied to one person. While this card in some cases can represent pure, unadulterated love, it can also indicate a choice.

But if this card is drawn with, say, the Five or Six of Pentacles where one is broke or where someone is giving coins to beggars, it could indicate that it’s a relationship out of pity, or lacks emotions, and that it’s not based on love. It is good to be skilled in the art of card combinations, when making a solid prediction on one’s love life. This card definitely means attachment, so someone is going to be in love, or have feelings, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that both parties will return the same emotion.

Some may say if you reverse the Hanged Man, it looks like he is dancing a sailors jig with his hands behind his back, which may be a reason that this card is associated with the planet of the sea god, Neptune.

Following this card is the Death card where the Fool has to give up his past in order to move on into the future.

He is bridging the gap between the divine and time. But it is in the experience of time standing still that he is able to figure out the meaning of life because he has that opportunity to pause. Which is the reason for the halo, he is gaining understanding of what his true purpose is, and what is the true meaning of life. Our lives are all a sacrifice, because none of us get out alive. Our lives are an experience of our higher power in the human body. No matter what, The Hanged Man is going to come down from his gallows, and will face his fate be it death or life.

The second possibility is that a reversed Star card is suggesting that you’re believing something that is so extraordinarily over-the-top that it cannot be possible. In fact, you might be deluding yourself in order to get there. So, this position can either mean that we don’t believe in ourselves enough <em>or </em>that we’re avoiding red flags that suggest our desire simply isn’t possible.</p>"
